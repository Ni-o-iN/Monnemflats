            <h3>Right to restriction of processing            </h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can 
                contact us at any time. Right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the 
                    duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your 
                    personal data.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of 
                    data processing instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have 
                    the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be 
                    carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request 
                    the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>
                If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data &ndash; apart from its storage &ndash; may 
                only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the 
                protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the 
                European Union or of a Member State are processed.

                In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your terminal device when you enter our site

            </p> 
            <p>
                Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not 
                work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate 
                user behavior or display advertising.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions that 
                you have requested (e.g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.g. cookies to measure the 
                web audience) (necessary cookies) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis 
                is specified. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and 
                optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies 
                has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a 
                DSGVO and Â§ 25 para. 1 TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.
